index: the "homepage" of my website, here I impletmented the .class selector, named block, to decorate 
a sentence.

index2: 2nd page of the website. Used the bootstrap grid model to display some of my hobbies. All 4 are
listed horizontally on a large screen but when the screen becomes smaller, it changes to a 2 by 2, then a 
vertical list. I linked images found online.

index3: 3rd page of the website. here I used the unordered list, #id, and scss nesting. Implemented the 
#id selector, named style, into h2 for font, font size, and border. Also implemented scss nesting to make 
paragraph text green and the listed text within orange.

index4: 4th page of the website. Couldn't think of anything to put on it so I just used the bootstrap 
components, button and alert, to inform that the page is WIP and the button links back to the homepage.

mystyle: the stylesheet for the website, converted from the scss file. the css properties used are font, 
background, text, color, and display

sassstyle: used @media to change background image when screen size changes. scss variable is used to for
text-align placement. scss inheritance is used for text font.
